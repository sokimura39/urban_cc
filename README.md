# The Urban Creative Commons

This repository hosts the website for the Urban Creative Commons, created as part of the ARC6975 Trajectories of Spatial Practices module at the University of Sheffield.

This website supplements the physical exhibition with additional data and information about the project. It is built using Quarto and hosted on GitHub Pages.
