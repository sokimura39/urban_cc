## The Risks

Shimizu is facing multiple issues that impact the city's future. While these issues are not unique to this city but rather a common phenomenon in Japan, Shimizu was used as a prime example of such issues.

### The Decline of Population

The population decline is a severe issue, with the population expected to half by 2070.

The population density of each area is predicted to change as shown here.

### Earthquakes, Tsunamis, and Liquefaction

Earthquakes have always been the threat to the Pacific region in Japan. The architecture stock in Japan might be able to withstand the force of the earthquake itself, but the tsunami and liquefaction that follow lead to serious consequences.

The Nankai Trough earthquake

Here, we visualize the two major factors that are the consequences of the earthquake. We must note that the magnitude of the earthquake is very severe in all parts of the city.

### Tsunami

### Liquefaction

### Flooding

Flooding due to excessive rain is a large issue. The various rivers that run through the city has caused flooding in the past, and is still expected to occur during events of heavy rain.

## The Potential

At the same time, there are multiple factors that are positive. The most valuable assets might be the views of Mount Fuji and the World Heritage Site of Miho Pine Groves, but the data also indicates tangible assets.

### Land Value

The land value is higher in areas with high potential - this includes around the station and the harbourside. These areas are of high demand, potentially being sites for redevelopment.

### Elevation

The physical aspects must not be forgotten - the natural aspects are also what makes this area special. The Nihondaira Highlands is an ideal spot to look around the city, thanks to its elevation. It also provides precious evacuation sites during tsunamis.
